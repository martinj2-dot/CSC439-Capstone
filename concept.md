# Project Name: Paper Trader

## **Goals**

The goal of this project is to allow users to practice maintaining a portfolio without having to spend any real money. 
Each user will create a profile so that their portfolio is saved and can be managed for as long they please.

## **Context**

Paper trading web sites are intended to let users practice managing a stock portfolio without risking any of their own money. 
The intended purpose of this project is to teach the user money management and risk assessment skills that can translate into 
managing their real portfolio.

## **Novelty**

My website will provide aggregated tips and information to help the user make good decisions. Some things that I would like
to include are: an analysis of all good and bad trades, tips to make better trades, and an overall portfolio analysis.

## **Functionality**

The functionality of the website is as follows:
- User creates a profile: Here they will setup their portfolio which will include a chosen fake dollar amount to start investing in a stock/option etc,.
- From their portfolio they can search any stock/etf/stock option to invest in, as long as they can afford it.
- Since the website will be used to simulate managing a real portfolio, users can only buy/sell on hours when the U.S. stock market is open.
- Once they choose to buy/sell an investment, they can go back to their profile and see how much they have lost/gained on a graph.

## **Audience**

Anyone can learn to manage an investment portfolio, but the main barrier to entry is starting money. With this website you can learn 
how to manage a portfolio safely without any intial investment or risk.

## **Challenges**

The main challenge I will encounter is not having enough time to implement this project. I will have to learn a few new technologies to create 
this website the way I want to.

## **Measures**

Measues I will use are as follows:
- Milestone 1: setuping up development environment. 
- Milestone 2: Begin creating a wireframe of the website
- Milestone 3: Begin developing the web application
- Milestone 4: Impliment main functionality of the web-application: Portfolio management
- Milestone 5: TBD

## **Motivation**

I have always been interested with financial literacy and I feel like it is an important thing to have to acheive financial indipendence.
Personally I wanted to learn new frameworks and languages as my main motivation. This project will provide experience developing using the Spring 
framework as the backend with a Angular as the frontend framework. I will also learn how to utilize a REST API to bring in data to be used in my application.\

## **Future Extensions**

Things I will like to add:

- More robust financial advice
- More educationally focused
