### About

The vision for this website was to bring about an easily accessible way for everyone to learn about portfolio management and managing their own finances. I have always had an interest in learning how the stock market operates in order to gain financial independence. Since the focus of this is to teach and allow users to learn freely, my objective is to bring a wealth of information and learning to as many users as possible.
